# Usage
To add animated gray loader on any view:
```
view.showLoader()
```

To hide animated loader:
```
view.hideLoader()
```

You can ask is loader showing:
```
if view.isLoaderShowing() {
  view.hideLoader()
}
```

You can show loader with own custom colors and animation duration:
```
 let backColorRed = UIColor(red: 255.0 / 255, green: 75.0 / 255, blue: 97.0 / 255, alpha: 1.0)
 let firstLoadColorRed = UIColor(red: 239.0 / 255, green: 64.0 / 255, blue: 85.0 / 255, alpha: 1.0)
 let secondLoadColorRed = UIColor(red: 225.0 / 255, green: 54.0 / 255, blue: 75.0 / 255, alpha: 1.0)
 let colorsRed = [backColorRed, firstLoadColorRed, secondLoadColorRed, firstLoadColorRed, backColorRed]
 view.showLoader(colors: colorsRed, animationDuration: 1.5)
```
‼️ 'colors' array should get only 5 different colors
